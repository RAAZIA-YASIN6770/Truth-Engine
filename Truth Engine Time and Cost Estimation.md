**Time and Cost Estimation Document**

**Truth Engine**

(Aligned with IEEE 1058, IEEE 29148 & Industry Project Estimation Practices)

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

This document defines the **Time Estimation and Budget Planning** for the *Truth Engine* project. It is prepared by strictly following the approved **SRS** and **Planning Phase** documents and reflects **industry-standard software estimation practices**.

The document is suitable for:

* Academic submission (FYP / thesis)
* Industry review
* Client or stakeholder presentation

**1.2 Estimation Basis**

The estimates in this document are derived using:

* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* Expert judgment (single-developer system)
* Bottom-up estimation technique
* Comparable project analysis (logic-based systems)

**2. Project Size Estimation**

**2.1 Functional Size**

The system is classified as a **small-to-medium deterministic web application** with:

* No real-time processing
* No external integrations
* High logical correctness requirements

Estimated functional modules:

* Scenario management
* Logic evaluation engine
* UI interaction layer
* Attempt & progression control
* Testing & validation layer

**3. Time Estimation**

**3.1 Phase-wise Time Breakdown**

| **Phase** | **Activities** | **Estimated Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning & Analysis | SRS finalization, estimation, RTM | 1 week |
| System Design | Architecture, data schema, UI design | 1 week |
| Implementation | Backend logic + frontend integration | 2 weeks |
| Testing & Validation | Logical testing, usability testing | 1 week |
| Deployment & Review | Browser deployment, documentation | 1 week |

**Total Estimated Project Duration:** **6 Weeks**

**3.2 Effort Estimation (Person-Weeks)**

| **Phase** | **Effort (Person-Weeks)** |
| --- | --- |
| Planning & Analysis | 1.0 |
| System Design | 1.0 |
| Implementation | 2.5 |
| Testing & Validation | 1.0 |
| Deployment & Review | 0.5 |

**Total Estimated Effort:** **6 Person-Weeks**

**4. Cost Estimation Model**

**4.1 Costing Assumptions**

* Single skilled software developer
* Industry-standard junior-to-mid level rate
* No hardware procurement cost
* Open-source tools only

Assumed developer rate:

* **USD 12 / hour** (international baseline)
* **PKR equivalent adjustable** for local context

**4.2 Cost Breakdown (USD)**

| **Phase** | **Hours** | **Cost (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning & Analysis | 40 | 480 |
| System Design | 40 | 480 |
| Implementation | 100 | 1,200 |
| Testing & Validation | 40 | 480 |
| Deployment & Review | 20 | 240 |

**Total Estimated Development Cost:** **USD 2,880**

**4.3 Cost Breakdown (PKR – Approximate)**

*(Based on exchange rate approximation)*

| **Phase** | **Cost (PKR)** |
| --- | --- |
| Planning & Analysis | 135,000 |
| System Design | 135,000 |
| Implementation | 340,000 |
| Testing & Validation | 135,000 |
| Deployment & Review | 70,000 |

**Total Estimated Cost:** **≈ PKR 815,000**

**5. Cost Categories**

**5.1 Direct Costs**

* Development labor
* Testing effort

**5.2 Indirect Costs (Not Charged)**

* Internet
* Electricity
* Learning curve

**6. Schedule Feasibility Analysis**

The estimated timeline is considered **feasible and realistic** because:

* Scope is tightly controlled
* No external dependencies exist
* Deterministic logic reduces uncertainty
* Iterative development allows early validation

**7. Risk Contingency Buffer**

A contingency buffer of **10–15%** effort may be applied for:

* Scenario complexity increase
* Additional validation cycles

Adjusted maximum duration: **7 weeks**

**8. Industry Alignment Statement**

This estimation model aligns with:

* IEEE 1058 project planning guidelines
* Common software consultancy estimation practices
* Startup MVP budgeting models

It reflects a **transparent, auditable, and professional estimation** approach.

**9. Approval**

This Time and Budget Estimation Document serves as the official reference for project execution, monitoring, and academic or industrial evaluation.
